# Apache-Beam-Batch-and-Streaming-Project


1. BeamOnColab.ipynb
This is the batch implementation, which can be tested on Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Streaming.py
This is the streaming implementation, which can be tested on Google Dataflow.

The batch and streaming implementations are all based on Apache Beam and share nearly the same code.
